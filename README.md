## INTRODUCTION
The main objective of the report is to create a good graph for the dataset. The dataset is related to the period of market volatility, investors invested in gold to minimize their risk of losing money. As a result of the coronavirus, which has caused the worst volatility in financial markets in a decade’s gold has seen its highest weekly rise since 2008. I have selected this visualization because the visualization looked a little disturbing and lacked to give detailed information. When a graph is visually pleasing and simple to understand, it is deemed good. All axes and data points should be accurately depicted and proportioned, and it should be properly labeled. There should be no stray marks or faulty data points on the graph as well. Color distinction across different data sets can also help consumers distinguish between data sets and avoid information overload. In addition to being clear and succinct, a good graph is easy to understand. It should express the facts in an easy-to-understand manner, with no unnecessary details or ambiguous data.

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to improve the clarity and effectiveness of a poorly designed graph by creating a more understandable visualization using the R programming language. The goal is to enhance the communication of data insights by addressing issues such as confusing layout, unclear labeling, or inappropriate chart types in the original graph.

#### 1 . Graph Analysis:
Understand the dataset and the intended message that the original graph was supposed to convey.

#### 2. Select Appropriate Visualization:
Consider alternatives to the original graph type.

#### 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Ensure that the dataset is clean and formatted correctly for the chosen visualization.
Address any missing or inconsistent data that might affect the new graph.

#### 4.  R Programming Implementation:
Utilize R programming language to create a new and improved visualization.
Select relevant R packages (e.g., ggplot2) to generate high-quality graphics.

#### 5. Improvement of Visual Elements:
Enhance visual elements such as color, size, and shape to improve clarity.
Implement appropriate labeling, titles, and annotations to provide context and understanding.

#### 6. Iterative Design Process:
Engage in an iterative design process by obtaining feedback from others.
Make adjustments to the visualization based on feedback to ensure that it effectively communicates the intended message.

#### 7. Documentation:
Document the steps taken to improve the graph, including code comments and a brief explanation of the rationale behind design decisions.
Provide guidelines for interpreting the new visualization.
